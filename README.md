So basically this internship was based on Data Science ....
And was provided to me by Oasis infobyte ...
Detailed statement of internship are as follows 

Task 1 :
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. 
Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is 
to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

Task 2 :
UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage 
of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp Increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the 
unemployment rate can be a good data science project.

Task 3:
EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
Weve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number 
of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize
and classify emails into spam and non-spam.
